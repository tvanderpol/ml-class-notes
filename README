Introduction
============

These are my personal notes taken while studying for ml-class.org

There was a little interest in what I used to put these notes together (or maybe even how I used it to do just that) so I figured I'd put the raw LaTeX files up for grabs here.

Caveats
=======

* As mentioned, these are my personal notes. I make no guarantee as to the correctness of these scribbles
* Not all language is entirely formal. Nothing terrible or anything but at times I might've been frustrated with a particular topic.
* I refer to the 'scratchpad' at times. These are just word processor files with a bunch of screenshots from the lectures. They are mostly visual aids for the issue at hand and shouldn't be strictly necessary to understanding. If there's points where it really doesn't make sense, put a pull request together!

License
=======

I put a CC by-nc (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) license on this stuff. Mostly because I only realised at the last minute I should probably make some sort of statement on that one way or the other.
